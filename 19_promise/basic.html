    <h4>Promise</h4>
    <p>
        The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its
        resulting value.
    </p>
    <div>
        <h4>A Promise is in one of these states:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. </li>
            <li> fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully. </li>
            <li> rejected: meaning that the operation failed. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
