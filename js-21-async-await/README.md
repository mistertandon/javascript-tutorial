 ### Thumb rules for using async and await
 
 - async functions returns a promise.
 - async functions use an implicit Promise to return its result. Even if you donâ€™t return a promise explicitly async function makes sure that your code is passed through a promise.
 - await blocks the code execution within the async function.
 - There can be multiple await statements within a single async function.
 - When using async await make sure to use try catch for error handling.
 - Be extra careful when using await within loops and iterators. You might fall into the trap of writing sequentially executing code when it could have been easily done in parallel.
 - await is always for a single promise.
