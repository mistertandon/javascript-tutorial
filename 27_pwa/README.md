### What is a PWA?
> PWA stands for Progressive Web Application. Let’s examine it by splitting it into two parts. The latter two words (“Web Application”) speak for themselves. PWAs are web applications. Here, web application simply means an app running as a website like, for example, Twitter. The first part of the term – Progressive – means that the user experience is enhanced gradually based on the browser’s capabilities. Essentially this means that the web application works well in older browsers but can utilise newer technologies to enhance the experience if the user is using a browser supporting them. Sounds simple, right? So where is the term from?

> The term was introduced by Google Chrome engineer Alex Russell in his blog post in 2015. Since then, Google has been promoting their usage actively and provided a lot of resources on the topic such as a site explaining them in more detail.

> While giving presentations around PWAs I always encounter the same confusion at this point. “So… Is it a technology? Is it a standard? Is it something owned/patented by Google?” No, none of those. It is simply a term to describe a specific way to design and build applications. Next, let’s try to understand what they are by going through the characteristics.

 - Here are the original 9 characteristics of PWA by Alex Russell with an explanation as to what they mean in this context:

   - Responsive: Page looks good on different screen sizes (e.g. phone, tablet, desktop)
   - Connectivity independent: Function without Internet connection
   - App-like-interactions: Look’n’feel of native application
   - Fresh: Always up-to-date
   - Safe: Utilise secure connection to mitigate multiple types of security threats
   - Discoverable: Browsers identify PWAs automatically
   - Re-engageable: Can bring users back to the app using, for example, Push Notifications
   - Installable: Can be stored to the home screen just like native apps but without the extra hassle of the App Store
   - Linkable: Can be shared around as plain URLs

 - For the reader of this blog post the most important functionalities are:

   - Installability to the home screen
   - Access to multiple native APIs such as camera, geolocation, vibration, payments etc.
   - Support for Push Notifications
   - Offline usage
   - Full screen and splash screen support
